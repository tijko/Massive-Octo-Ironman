# Massive-Octo-Ironman

Massive-Octo-Ironman is a wallpaper changer.  It uses the daily image from [APOD]('http://apod.nasa.gov').

There shell scripts for automating the changing of the wallpaper and depending on your DE the command will be different(this is for gnome3).

You can set it up to run as a cronjob daily too.
